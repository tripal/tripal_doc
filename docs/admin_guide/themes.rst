Themes
======

In addition to a rich library of extension modules, Drupal also supports customizing your site by using themes. Themes can change the look and feel of your site, and in some cases, influence functionality.


Default Themes
--------------

Drupal comes with several default themes. One is for user-facing pages such as content and the other is for administrative views. These can be found by navigating to ``admin/appearance`` or by clicking the "Appearance" button on the administrative toolbar.

Installing Themes
------------------

Similar to :doc:`modules <modules>`, there are several ways to install and manage themes. 

In an effort not to duplicate documentation, it is recommended to refer to `Drupal's own documentation <https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420>`__ on this subject.

If you find a theme that you wish to use on your site, or if you want to create your own theme, they can be placed in the following directory to be detected by Drupal.


Tripal Theme
------------

Tripal 4 does not come with its own theme. Most sites elect to either use the default Drupal themes or to provide their own, so Tripal does not provide one, and only provides a minimal default layout for content types. More information on laying out your content types can be found in the :doc:`Page Layout </site_building/page_layout>` section.
